## Description
I kinda started coding about a year ago, and, I was wanting to become a Video Game Designer/Creator when I become 18. I started coding when I started playing minecraft, so about last year. I create servers. But am still figuring out how to set up a VPN. My project is going to be created with Minecraft. I have one wish throughout this project, and that wish is to become well-known. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.
